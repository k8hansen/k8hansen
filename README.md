### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a former new media artist + Public Art project manager, turned dev.  I'm still pretty green.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS and React, with the goal of someday being a JS wizard!
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything!  I love working with people!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about how I pivoted into being a mid-life dev.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: [my website](www.k8hansen.com) for now, it's being updated!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can say the alphabet backwards really fast.  My second grade teacher made us learn it backwards, too.
